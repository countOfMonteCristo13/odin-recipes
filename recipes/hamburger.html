        <li>500g good quality beef mince</li>

        <li>Tip 500g beef mince into a bowl with 1 small diced onion and 1 egg, then mix</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into four</li>
        <li>Lightly wet your hands</li>
        <li>Carefully roll the mixture into balls, each about the size of a tennis ball</li>
        <li>Set in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze down to flatten into patties about 3cm thick</li>
        <li>Make sure all the burgers are the same thickness so that they will cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Put on a plate, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 mins</li>
        <li>Heat the barbecue to medium hot </li>
        <li>Lightly brush one side of each burger with vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the barbecue</li>
        <li>Cook for 5 mins until the meat is lightly charred.</li>
        <li>Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to rest on a plate so that all the juices can settle inside</li>
        <li>Slice four burger buns in half.</li>
        <li>Place, cut-side down, on the barbecue rack and toast for 1 min until they are lightly charred</li>
        <li>Place a burger inside each bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment</li>
    </ol>
