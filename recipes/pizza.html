    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the base</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp instant yiest</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oli, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the tomato sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil of 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Base</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.</li>
        <li>Pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth</li>
        <li>Cover with a tea towel and set aside</li>
        <li>You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste</li>
        <li>Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough</li>
        <li>If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin</li>
        <li>The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven</li>
        <li>Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf</li>
        <li>Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon</li>
        <li>Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season</li>
        <li>Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp</li>
        <li>Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using</li>
        <li>Repeat step for remaining pizza</li>
    </ol>
